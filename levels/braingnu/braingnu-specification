The Braingnu language is an open source standard
and is unique in also being a one-to-one
functional replacement for Brainfuck.

The language has eight operators, each
manipulating a pointer in memory or input/output.
The operators are as follows:

gold   Write current memory location to output
gnu    Save character from standard input to memory
gno    Decrement Pointer (Move left)
gyes   Increment Pointer (Move right)
gup    Increment current value
gdown  Decrement current value
gthere If the value at the current position
       is nonzero go to the matching ghere
ghere  If the value at the current position
       is zero jump to the matching gthere.
